# Meetings notes

## Meeting 1.
* **DATE: 15.2.2021**
* **ASSISTANTS: Marta Cortes Orduna**

### Minutes
Overall deadline 1 return was good but main concepts need to be clarified a bit. Some entities could be changed to be properties of movies and series and the diagram had things that did not belong there. Relationships of the concepts also need to be better defined and structured.

### Action points
Change actor from entity to property of a movie/series.
Structure items under genres.
Movies under movie list and series under series list.
Delete client from the diagram and change relationships to represent the new structure.
